Python 3.8 Ascii-art tetris


Ascii Art Tetris! Run python3 tetris.py

Requires python 3.8 for the f-strings functionality.  
If that gives you trouble, there are only 3 f-strings in the program, just search for ```f"``` and replace those three lines with a .format call and the program would work in any python 3 version.
